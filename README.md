MinecraftModelExporter
======================

A simple tool for converting Minecraft worlds into models.

The main reason why I started to work on this is a special feature.
This tool can optimize models, so instead of just exporting all the block faces, it connects them, so the model will contain less triangles.

Todo:
-Clean the code
-Add unsupported blocks (mostly those blocks are not supported which has models, so most of the cube blocks are supported)
